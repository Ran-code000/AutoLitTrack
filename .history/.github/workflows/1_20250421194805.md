## 🌟 **Project Background and Objectives**

In scientific research and academia, staying updated with the latest papers, technological breakthroughs, and industry trends is crucial. However, traditional manual search methods (e.g., browsing platforms like arXiv) are inefficient, requiring researchers to spend significant time on keyword filtering, webpage navigation, and content organization.

This project aims to develop an **Automated Literature Tracking and Smart Summarization System** to optimize the process of acquiring research information through the following approaches:

- 🕷️ **Automated Crawling**: Based on user-defined keywords, daily retrieval of the latest literature from target platforms (e.g., arXiv, CNKI, IEEE Xplore).  
- 🤖 **Smart Summarization**: Utilize large language model APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Wenxin Yiyan) to perform structured extraction of literature content and generate concise summaries.  
- 📬 **Personalized Notifications**: Deliver categorized information to users via a visual interface (Web/App), supporting multi-dimensional filtering and interaction.  
- 🧠 **Agent Optimization**: In the future, incorporate intelligent agent technology to dynamically learn user preferences and automatically adjust retrieval strategies.

### **Ultimate Goals**
- 🚀 **Short-Term**: Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) supporting core literature tracking and summarization functionalities.  
- 🌍 **Long-Term**: Build a comprehensive research workflow platform, integrating features like literature management, collaborative analysis, and trend forecasting.

## 🔑 **Key Features and Workflow**

### **3.1 User-Side Features**
1. 🔍 **Keyword Management**  
   - Users input domain-specific keywords (e.g., "deep learning," "gene editing"), supporting Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) combinations.  
   - Optional prebuilt domain templates (e.g., computer science, biomedicine) with auto-suggested keywords.  

2. 📄 **Literature Summary Display**  
   - Daily updated lists sorted by relevance or date, with filtering options (e.g., "top conference papers only," "within the last week").  
   - Example summary template:  
     ```markdown
     **Title**: [Protein Design Optimization Using Diffusion Models]  
     **Authors**: Zhang et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 2024)  
     **Core Contribution**: Proposed a novel diffusion framework, improving protein generation speed by 40%, with experimentally validated stability surpassing traditional methods.  
     **Technical Highlight**: Introduced geometric constraint loss function to address folding path conflicts.  
     **Potential Limitation**: Requires GPU clusters, leading to high computational costs.
     ```

3. 📊 **Visual Analysis**  
   - Generate trending keyword clouds, author collaboration networks, and technology trend timelines.  
   - Support for exporting reports in CSV/PDF formats.

## ⚠️ **Potential Challenges and Solutions**
| **Challenge**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚫 **Platform Anti-Scraping Restrictions** | Use rotating proxy IPs, simulate browser behavior (Playwright), prioritize open APIs (e.g., arXiv). |
| 💸 **Large Model Cost Control**        | Pre-extract key sentences (TF-IDF/BERT) before summary generation to reduce token usage; offer a free tier with daily limits. |
| 🌐 **Multilingual Literature Processing** | Integrate translation APIs (e.g., DeepL) to support mixed Chinese-English summaries. |
| 🔒 **User Privacy and Data Security**  | Comply with GDPR/domestic regulations, encrypt user data, provide anonymous keyword mode. |
